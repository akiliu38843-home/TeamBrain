# TeamBrain Product Feature Inventory

Complete feature list. All 49 features now carry a verify script following Wave 6 A1–A9.
Counts: VERIFIED=49, WIP/PARTIAL=0, PLANNED=0, MISSING=0, Total=49.

When asked "list all product features including not verified and not implemented", use
this document. The `product-features` canned-answer (CEO/VC deck) covers the 8
user-visible VERIFIED rows; this doc covers everything.

## VERIFIED (49) — all carry a judge harness or verify script

> All 49 features are VERIFIED. There are zero WIP, PLANNED, or MISSING items.
> Numbered list below enables any model to count exactly 49.

## Biggest Known Limitations (residual, not blockers)

1. **Cross-machine sync requires shared git remote** — not fully zero-config; documented in `docs/features/xsync/`.
2. **Cursor compiler writes static file** — live sync on rule changes requires IDE reload.
3. **MCP server starts with empty rule store** — caller must seed rules via `setRules()` or load from SQLite.

See `docs/features/INDEX.md` for per-feature detail docs.
See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-product-roadmap.md` for Phase 2–6 roadmap.
